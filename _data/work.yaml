    *Each year Samsung hosts a $2 million national competition for public schools grades 6â€“12 in which students are asked to consider how 
    science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) can be used to create change in their communities. With the help of their teachers, students can apply to the contest 
    and compete to win up to $100,000 in prizes for their school, plus the opportunity to work with Samsung employees to develop their prototypes.* ~ From Samsung's SFT Website
