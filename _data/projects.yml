    Services such as Mailchimp make spreading the word too difficult, with a complicated setup and costly monthly charges.
    Along with these deficits, they also insert advertisements on the signup flow, making it a bad choice for small businesses.
    Ashmail has all the benefits one would please to have in a mass emailing system, without any of the negatives.

    Hyde is a simple static site generator which I made as a replacement for jekyll, 
    which is too complicated for simple uses and not suitable for quick style changes.
